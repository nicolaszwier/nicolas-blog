## What a day...

While I'm writing this text, I'm living in any of those days that are pretty hard to just sit and start working on some task without my mind starts to travel to many other places, except the job, that is the thing that I should be focused right now.

Sometimes, understand what a task is asking for, think about it in the best solutions, and actually apply any of these solutions became extremely hard when your mind is at the same time, thinking about that thing you should learn after work, in that course you bought, watched a few lessons and left the course alone, or just worried if you doing a good job: "What if I'm not working well?".

Look, all of this is happening at the same time while I'm sitting and looking for my computer screen trying to work. Then, after a few hours, the workday ends, and you realize that you did (almost) nothing, and now you have one more thing to get your mind worried: The due date of that task is soon, and I didn't have good progress yet.

So what happens? Your leader comes to speak with you and say: "Hey, you're doing well, keep going your nice work" (ðŸ¤¯). What do you mean I'm doing well? I definitely didn't see that coming.

Having feedbacks is great, even if it is bad feedback that will help to realize where you can get better or even better if the feedback is positive, as I described above. 
But then I realized, I'm having some bad days, but still getting positive feedback. So it means that I'm doing my work well, even if it's not clear in my head. 

## How to focus on work and be more productive?

Well, unfortunately, I don't have a formula that will improve your productivity a lot (sorry ðŸ˜›). Actually, I'm still looking for a solution, but there are some actions that helped me to realize that not everything is lost, and there are some days that things are doing great, actually.

### The most important and maybe the hardest: organization

Yes, we need to get organized. But I'm not talking about creating a complex routine and planning in detail what I'm going to do in my day. The more complexity we add to any task, the less chance it has to work or to continue doing after a while.

There's a thing that is helping me to no get lost between a lot of stuff to do. I write down the tasks that I have to do today, in the simplest way possible, which could be even a piece of paper. It helps me to organize everything inside my head, make me think: "I have these tasks for today, if I finish them, great! Duty accomplished! âœ”"

Then every time I finish something, I scratch the task, or I move to the 'Tasks done' column when I'm doing it on my laptop. When I do that, I can see the tasks getting done, one by one, and it feels good! But even if I can't finish all tasks, at least a little bit of that feeling that I couldn't do anything today go away: "Ok, at least I finish some tasks ðŸ˜ª"

Another thing that I can see now, our work isn't repetitive and demands to be very concentrated, to have creativity, and think a lot. So it's impossible to be productive all the time. Understanding and accepting this is very
