## What a day...

While I'm writing this text, I'm living in any of those days that are pretty hard to just sit and start working on some task without my mind starts to travel to many other places, except the job, that is the thing that I should be focused right now.

Sometimes, understand what a task is asking for, think about it in the best solutions, and actually apply any of these solutions became extremely hard when your mind is at the same time, thinking about that thing you should learn after work, in that course you bought, whatched a few lessons and left the course alone, or just worried if you doing a good job: "What if I'm not working well?".

Look, all of this is happening at the same time while I'm sitting and looking for my computer screen trying to work. Then, after a few hours, the workday ends, and you realize that you did (almost) nothing, and now you have one more thing to get your mind worried: The due date of that task is soon, and I didn't have good progress yet.

So what happens? Your leader comes to speak with you and say: "Hey, you're doing well, keep going your nice work" (ðŸ¤¯). What do you mean I'm doing well? I definitely didn't see that coming.

Having feedbacks is great, even if it is bad feedback that will help to realize where you can get better or even better if the feedback is positive, as I described above. 
But then I realized, I'm having some bad days, but still getting positive feedback.
