### About me

Hi, my name is Nicolas Zwierzykowski, I'm 23 years old and I'm a Software Engineer. I have more than 4 years of experience in the IT area, about 2 and a half years working as a client support and since then as a software developer.

### Purpose of this blog

One of the main reasons that made me create this blog is because I believe that the best way to fix something that we have learned is to teach! And even someone who doesn't have a lot of experience can still pass on some useful knowledge.

Another reason is a situation that every software developer go through, or are going to, is when they encounter a problem "without a solution" or at least is not documented anywhere. Many hours are spent working on it, and when we finally come up with a solution I think it is a good idea to document it to help other developers experiencing the same problem.

And the last reason, a great project to put learning into practice would be to develop a blog from scratch. And here's the result! ðŸ˜œ

### Wich subjects will I find here?

This is definitelly NOT a blog only about Front-end, or ReactJS, or Backend, etc. I'm going to create here a new post every time I learn a new thing that I think would be nice to be shared with other people 

### Conclusion

I hope you enjoy the content that I'll create here. Feel free to comment, share and, if you want to chat with me about anything, please send me a message on one of my social media that has the link available on the homepage.

If you find some mistakes here, please let me know! ðŸ˜‰

Thank's for your attention and see you in the next post!
